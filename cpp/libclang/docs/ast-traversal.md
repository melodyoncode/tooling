# libclang C++ source analysis

This document is the entry point for the parser's analysis of a C++ source
file. The parser creates one libclang translation unit for each input file and
walks its AST recursively. It extracts a class-diagram model and a callable
control-flow model from eligible entities.

Detailed extraction contracts are documented separately:

- [Function extraction and control flow](function-extraction.md)
- [Class and enum extraction](type-extraction.md)

## Translation units and the main file

In libclang terminology, the *main file* is the input file of one parse
operation; it is not necessarily the C++ program's `main.cpp`. For example,
when parsing `src/service.cpp`, declarations and definitions in that file are
in the main file, while entities brought in through `#include` are not.

Function extraction keeps only callable definitions from the main file. This
avoids extracting an inline function from a shared header once for every
translation unit that includes it. A header-only function is extracted when
that header is itself an input file.

## Analysis flow

`Visitor` recursively walks the translation-unit AST. For each entity that is
not filtered out, it dispatches to the relevant specialized visitor:

| Entity kind | Analysis |
| --- | --- |
| `ClassDecl`, `StructDecl`, `ClassTemplate`, and `ClassTemplatePartialSpecialization` | Extract class/struct entities, members, aliases, bases, and relationship inputs. |
| `EnumDecl` | Extract enum entities and literals. |
| `FunctionDecl`, `FunctionTemplate`, and `Method` | Extract callable definitions and their body control flow. Function templates are classified as free functions, methods, or static methods according to their scope. |

After traversal, class relationship resolution uses the collected base,
variable, and method type information to populate the class-diagram
relationships.

## Source filtering

Before dispatch, the parser omits entities located in system or external paths,
or entities in excluded namespaces such as `std`. Namespace cursors are
traversal containers; visitors derive namespace and type ownership from each
entity's semantic-parent chain rather than retaining mutable namespace state.

This filtering is distinct from the main-file rule: source filtering controls
whether an entity belongs in the parsed model at all, while the main-file rule
prevents duplicated callable definitions from project headers.
